Using Python to clean Whatsapp chat data and then eventually creating data visualizations using Power BI
In whatsapp.py I have added the code created using Python language.
Later in Power BI:
I have created some extra columns which helped me to eventually produce better graphs, Which are :::
Date.DayOfWeekName([Date])
Date.Day([Date])
Date.Month([Date])

If you think any changes are required or can be added please help me with it.
Thanks in advance!!
